=================

A universal knowledge topology connects all the computer science knowledge in the world.

And all of us can open an issue to share your story or raise a question, discuss about it, and precipitate this as an avaiable knowledge.

Gradually, we can build up a lot of nodes of knowledge, and finally build the topology.


What we can do
===============

All kinds of opinions on computer science are welcomed.

FAQ
===

  * How to contribute?

It's easy and just open an [issue](https://github.com/universe-proton/universe-topology/issues).


  * Can I only use english?

No, it depends on you. But we think that it's more friendly to use a common language like english, and all programmers can benift from this.


  * Is there any limitations about programming language?

No, all programming language are welcomed.


  * Why I should use issue than document file?

We hope that you can easily raise something rather than writing a document file and discuss in an independent context.

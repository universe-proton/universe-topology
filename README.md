=================

The universal knowledge topology connects all the computer science knowledge in the world.

And all of us can open an issue to share your story or raise a question, discuss about it, and precipitate this as available knowledge.

Gradually, we can build up a lot of nodes of knowledge, finally building the topology.


What we can do
===============

All kinds of opinions on computer science are welcomed.

FAQ
===

  * How to contribute?

It's easy. You may just start by opening an [issue](https://github.com/universe-proton/universe-topology/issues).


  * Can I only use english?

No, it depends on you. But we think that it's more friendly to use a common language like english, and all programmers can benift from it.


  * Are there any limits in programming language?

No, all programming languages are welcomed.


  * Why must I use issue here rather than document file?

Because it's easier to raise something than write a document file and we hope all of use can discuss about the issue in an independent context.
